# Spaceship

## Overview
This game is similar to the classic arcade game asteroids except that the focus here is to survive engagements with other ships rather than shooting asteroids. Survive by destroying enemy ships and upgrading your own.

## MVP

This game is very straightforward but will feature a simple AI for enemy ships.
(There’s no sound in space.)

## Wireframes:
